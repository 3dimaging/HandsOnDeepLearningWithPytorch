Sequential Data Processing

Arrangement for this chapter is bit different from previous chapter. Here we try to solve the same problem with different NLP techniques. The task for this chapter is to classify sentences as entailment, contradiction, and neutral. The dataset is provided by Stanford Natural Language Group and is called as The Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus. The brief from `SNLI page`_ 

.. _SNLI page: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/

	The SNLI corpus (version 1.0) is a collection of 570k human-written English sentence pairs manually labeled for balanced classification with the labels entailment, contradiction, and neutral, supporting the task of natural language inference (NLI), also known as recognizing textual entailment (RTE). We aim for it to serve both as a benchmark for evaluating representational systems for text, especially including those induced by representation learning methods, as well as a resource for developing NLP models of any kind.
